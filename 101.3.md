Change runlevels/boot targets and shutdown or reboot system
--
On systemd, we have different targets which are groups of services.
in SysV, it was called runlevels, but we don't really use Systemd anymore do we?

we can see the targets using the command:
	`systemctl list-units --type=targets`

we can get the info about a service using the command:
	`systemctl cat multi-user.target`
	`example output:
	`[Unit]
	`Description=Multi-User System
	`Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
	`Requires=basic.target
	`Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
	`After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
	`AllowIsolate=yes


in general, a Linux system can run at different targets depending on our situation and needs.

we can see the default target with:
`Systemctl get-default`

different default targets in systemctl include:
- rescue: local file systems are mounted, there is no networking and root user only.
- emergency: Only the root file system in read only mode. no networking and root-user only.
- reboot
- halt: stops all processes and halts CPU activities
- poweroff: like halt but also sends an ACPI shutdown signals (no lights!)

p.s: being root user only doesn't mean that we need a root password. physical access is enough.


##### SysV runlevels - init systems

On red-hat based systems we had:
- 0 - Shutdown
- 1 - Single user mode (recovery); also called S or s
- 2 - Multi-user without networking
- 3 - Multi-user with networking
- 4 - to be customized
- 5 - Multi-user with networking and graphics
- 6 - reboot


 and in Debian based systems we had:
 - 0 - shutdown
 - 1 - Single user mode
 - 2 - Multi user mod with graphics
 - 6 - reboot


although SysV is redundant, you can still use its commands in Systemd based systems.

we can get our run previous and current run-level via the command `runlevel`.

in the world of `SysV`, we had the `/etc/init.d/` directory which was full of bash scripts. nowadays, these files still exist but they are basically links to the actual files. you can find these links via `ls -ltrh`.


in the Unix world, processes have an ID called `pID`.


- The halt command halts the system.
	- closes the processes
	- tells the CPU to no more do any activities.
- The poweroff command halts the system and then attempts to power it off.
	- does the same as `halt`, with the difference that it shuts the electricity flow with ACPI.
- The reboot command halts the system and then reboots it.
	- same as poweroff command, but it reboots the system.



Considering most Unix systems were used as a server, these commands get flags that are usually used in the infrastructure world. you can view these flags using the `man` command.



you can notify the users by the following ways:
- wall - sending wall messages to logged in users
- `/etc/issue` - Text to be displayed on the tty terminal logins (before login)
- `/etc/issue.net` - Text to be displayed on the remote terminal logins (before login)
- `/etc/motd` - Message of the day (after login). some companies add "Do not enter if you are not allowed" texts here for legal reasons.
- `who -T` will show mesg status. Note that `shutdown` wall messages do not respects the `mesg` status.
- systemctl sends wall messages for emergency halt, power-off, reboot and rescue.
