OS is the software that connects the hardware and the applications together.

upon starting your PC, a firmware runs on it. in the past, this firmware was called BIOS(Basic input output system). BIOS was located on the MBR(Master Boot Record). currently, BIOS has been replaced with UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) which tackles many of the problems that BIOS had. It has a separate partition (in Linux, it's called /boot). we will get to these buzz words later.

you can add many peripheral devices to your computer. one of the ports that makes this action possible is called the PCI(Peripheral Component Interconnect) which lets hardware to be added to the motherboard. Nowadays motherboards use PCIExpress slots.

different PCI devices include but are not limited to:
- PATA (old)
- SATA (Serial & up to 4-devices)
- SCSI (Parallel & up to 8-devices)
- Network cards (RJ 45)
- Bluetooth
- video accelerators
- audio cards

USB was created to make users able to connect peripherals to the computer on the fly. with PCIE ports, you need to reboot the system to recognize the hardware.  

##### GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
- examples include: raspberry pi devices.

### Sysfs (a pseudo file system)

as mentioned above, Sysfs a pseudo file system and it's quite different from the actual file system. Sysfs happens in kernel's memory and it lets kernel's memory to show the information about the different parts of itself, different hardware and device drivers to the user. it being a pseudo file system means that it's not showing the files on the system. rather it is showing what's going on in the memory's kernel.

in another words, it lets the user to understand what's going on in the system in a file system like level.

you can access the Sysfs by entering the `/sys/fs` directory.

### udev (user space `/dev` )

the `/dev/` partition is basically what we have access to as a user. you can find the same "files" (remember, they are not actually files) which we found in `/sys/fs` and any changes to the these "files" will be applies to those in `/sys/` as well.


### D-bus
it's a message bus system, and it's a simple way for applications to talk with each other. D-bus also helps to coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.


### Proc (Processes) directory
Proc is also another pseudo file system and it can be found in `/proc`. it is how Linux thinks about processes and how it handles them. in `/proc/`, you can find:
- IRQs (Interrupt requests)
- I/O ports (locations in memory where CPU can talk with devices)
- DMA (direct memory access, faster than I/O ports)
- Processes
- Network Settings
- ...
you can find a lot of process numbers shown as files in `/proc/`, and after those you can find the items mentioned above.


### a couple of useful commands

#### lsusb
- lists usb devices

#### lspci
- lists pci devices 

#### lsblk
- lists block devices.
- Block devices are usually the ones that are readable and writable.

#### lshw
- lists ALL of the hardware connected to the computer.


## How Linux communicates with external devices (.ko files)

to communicate with an external device, we need a *Driver*.

fortunately, Linux drivers reside in the Kernel and they are called Loadable kernel modules. they are *loadable* and modular because storing all of the drivers in a kernel is an impossible tasks and it takes a toll on the system's performance. 
you can see the loaded modules with `lsmod` and manage them via `modprob`. you can remove modules with `rmmod` and insert them with `insmod`. note that you need to use the full address while using `insmod`. alternatively, you can use `modprobe` and you probably should.
