like any contemporary  OS, Linux uses files and directories to operate. Unlike Windows, we have a tree like file system.

Most of external devices (USB, CD, ...) are mounted at `/media/` or `/mnt/`.


#### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
the standard and the latest revision is for 2015.
- bin - Essential command binaries
- boot - Static files of the boot loader
- dev - Device files
- etc - Host-specific system configuration
- home - Home directory of the users
- lib - Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
- media - Mount point for removable media
- mnt - Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily
- opt - Add-on application software packages
- root - Home directory of the root user
- sbin - Essential system binaries
- srv - Data for services provided by this system
- tmp - temporary files, sometimes purged on each boot
- usr - Secondary hierarchy
- var - Variable data (logs,...)

#### Partitions
in the Linux world, device are defined at `/dev`.
First SATA or SCSI disks you will have `/dev/sda`. For newer NVME drives you can see `/dev/nvme0` and partitions are available as `/dev/nvme0n1`. and for PATA disks(redundant) you will see `/dev/hdc`. for external devices you will have `/dev/mmcblk0` and `/dev/mmcblk0p0` for them partitions.
