Boot The System
--
##### The boot process goes as the following:
- Motherboard Firmware does a PowerOnSelfTest (POST)
- Motherboard loads the bootloader
- Bootloader loads the Linux Kernel based on its configs/commands and loads it into the memory.
- Kernel loads and prepares the system (root file system) and runs the initialization program.
- Init program starts the services and other programs. (Web server, GUI, Networking, etc.)


##### BIOS
- Older
- Limited to one sector of the disk and needs a multi stage bootloader
- Can start the bootloader from Internal/External HDD, CD/DVD, USB Flash Drive, Network Server
- If we're booting from the HDD, MBR will be used.

##### UEFI
- Modern and fancy
- Specifies a special disk partition for the bootloader. Called EFI System Partition (ESP).
- ESP is FAT and mounted on `/boot/efi` and bootloader files .`efi`extensions.

##### Bootloader
- Initializes minimum hardware needed to boot the system.
- searches for Operating systems and runs them.

##### Kernel
- it's the core of your OS.
- it needs some initial info to start, things like drivers.
- this is where `initramfs` comes into play. it loads alongside the Kernel.
- you can pass parameters to the Kernel during boot.


##### dmesg
- Linux Logs the boot process and shows it during boot.
- you can view these logs either by pressing `esc` or `Ctrl+Alt+F1` during boot.
- because the Kernel doesn't have access to storage, it saves the data in a section called *Kernel Ring Buffer*.
- if you are using systemd, you can use `journalctl -k`.
- in addition, most systems keep the boot logs in a text life file too. they can be found under `/var/log/boot` and `var/log/boot.log` for Debian and Redhat based system respectively. 

##### init
- after boot, Kernel runs `init` which then runs different daemons.
- the init system takes care of process dependencies. for e.g: you can set the Program D to not run Unless program A & B have been initialized.

a little bit of history lesson:
- *SysVinit* is based on Unix System V. pretty old stuff. eventually it got replaced by *Systemd*.
- Upstart was an event-based replacement for the traditional init daemon developed by canonical. it got discontinued in 2015.
- Systemd is the new replacement. it's generally hated among Linux elitists for breaking away from Unix philosophies but you can find it in almost every popular Linux distribution. It can start services in parallel and do lots of fancy stuff!


##### Systemd
Systemd has a lot of options. it stores time stamps, it can show the core daemons and it's children, and it has a default target (usually `graphical.target`) that it has to reach. you can read the daemons details by running the `cat` command for `systemctl` followed by the daemon's name.
